# GTNH Jenkins Downloader
 
 This application updates minecraft mods from Gregtech New Horizons jenkins page.

 It was created for people who do not want to wait for a new development version and want the most unstable and up-to-date pack.

## It is still recommend to manually update to new dev version when it is available, this application only updates mods, if theres a new one, it wont be downloaded. Also the confings are not updated
